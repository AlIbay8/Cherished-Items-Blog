                <p>This is my favorite lamp. I like this lamp because it brightens up not only my room, but also my day and night. It's not the most conveniently shaped lamp, but I still cherish it. This post is dedicated to my lamp.</p>

                <p>This is a classic favorite for me. If you didn't know, this is not a fashionable slab of plastic, it's my laptop. It's quite an old one, but it still runs. It once said hello to me, I believe it's a Dell. This post is dedicated to my laptop.</p>

                <p>These are my headphones. I really love music. I also do have a music blog, but it seems this is my most popular blog so far. These headphones are pretty neat. They are Sony and they fit comfortably around my ears. I would recommend this. This post is dedicated to my headphones.</p>

                <p>I love my mailbox because it has brought me an experience that I never would have experienced before. Long story short, I learned how shopping online can help you meet new people. I met my mailman through this experience. I never met him before. I always thought packages and letters were brought to you through this magical engineering in a mailbox. Turns out I was wrong and that the truth was even better. This post is dedicated to my mailbox.</p>

                <p>I got this "Jabber Ball" at a convention. I like it because you can squeeze it and it makes a funny noise. Not only does it sound funny, it looks cute by sticking out it's tongue as well. I like to use it as a stress reliever whenever one of my blogs isn't going well or someone posts a negative comment. This thing has truly made my frown go upside down. This post is dedicated to my Jabber Ball.</p>

                <p>This is my refrigerator. I love my refrigerator because it keeps my food fresh. I don't have much money, so I need to make sure I buy just the right amount of food. If one of my foods expires, I'm starving for the day. I like to organize my refrigerator so that my food is separated into different days.</p>

                <p>I like my microwave because whenever I'm hungry, I pull something out of the refrigerator and heat it up in my microwave. One night, I found myself starving and sleepy, so I got up to heat up something. I soon realized I was eating a plate of microwaved lettuce.</p>

                <p>Time is very important in my life. I love that one quote about time, but I forgot what that quote was. What I do know is that time is valuable. I don't like to waste time. I keep track of time on this watch.</p>

                <p>I remember playing on this console. It was one of the only consoles I had. I would always play that one game "Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga." I need to replay that game, I forgot what happened to Peach in the end.</p>

                <p>This is my old phone. I like this phone because it doesn't have all that techno stuff that my smartphone has. I really want to switch back to this phone because it lets me disconnect from the internet. But know, I find myself creating blogs like these because some day, I won't have these items anymore.</p>
